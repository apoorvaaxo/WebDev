# Resume Project 1

This project is a simple resume-style webpage created using HTML to demonstrate proficiency with basic HTML concepts, including attributes, tags, lists, media elements, and semantic structure. The webpage organizes information with sections for About, Education, Experience, Skills, and Contact.

## Features

- **Semantic HTML5 Structure**: Utilizes semantic tags like `<header>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` for better structure and accessibility.
- **Navigation Menu**: Features a simple navigation bar with links to different sections of the resume.
- **Lists**: Uses unordered lists to structure sections like Education, Experience, and Skills.
- **Attributes**: Applies HTML attributes such as `href`, `src`, `alt`, and `target` across the document.
