        <p>Bhagat Singh (1907–1931) was one of India's most influential revolutionaries, widely remembered for his role in the Indian independence movement. He is celebrated for his courage, radical ideologies, and his ultimate sacrifice for the cause of freedom. Bhagat Singh became a symbol of resistance against British colonial rule, and his actions and writings continue to inspire people worldwide.</p>

        <p>Here is a timeline of significant events in his life:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>September 28, 1907: </strong>Bhagat Singh was born in Banga, Punjab (now in Pakistan) to Kishan Singh Sandhu and Vidyavati Kaur.</li>

            <li><strong>1920: </strong>Inspired by the freedom struggle, Bhagat Singh became involved in the non-cooperation movement led by Mahatma Gandhi. However, after the Chauri Chaura incident (where 22 policemen were killed by a mob), he distanced himself from Gandhi’s philosophy and began advocating for more direct, radical action.</li>

            <li><strong>1928: </strong>After the death of Lala Lajpat Rai from police brutality during a protest against Simon Commission, Bhagat Singh and his associates plotted to avenge his death by killing James A. Scott, the police officer responsible. However, they mistakenly killed J.P. Saunders, another officer.</li>

            <li><strong>April 8, 1929:  </strong>Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt threw bombs in the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi, aiming to protest against repressive laws. They did not intend to harm anyone but wanted to make their voices heard. Both were arrested, and during the trial, they used the platform to propagate their ideas on independence and resistance against colonial rule.</li>

            <li><strong>October 7, 1930: </strong>Bhagat Singh, along with his associates, was charged with the killing of J.P. Saunders and for his involvement in the assembly bomb case. The case garnered massive attention.</li>

            <li><strong>March 23, 1931:  </strong> Bhagat Singh, along with Rajguru and Sukhdev, was sentenced to death by hanging for his role in the assassination of J.P. Saunders. Despite widespread protests and appeals for clemency, they were executed on this day.</li>

            <li><strong>March 23, 1931: </strong>Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev were hanged at Central Jail, Lahore, at the young age of 23. Their martyrdom made them national heroes, and their legacy has had a lasting impact on India's struggle for independence.</li>
