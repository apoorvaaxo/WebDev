    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction to AI</h2>
        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, particularly computer systems, aimed at performing tasks that usually require human intelligence. Examples include speech recognition, decision-making, and visual perception.</p>
        <p>AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (e.g., YouTube, Amazon), and autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo)<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup>.</p>

    <!-- History -->
    <section id="history">
        <h2>History of AI</h2>
        <p>The study of AI began with mechanical reasoning in antiquity and evolved with Alan Turing's theory of computation<sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup>. In 1956, AI research formally began at a workshop at Dartmouth College, with early successes in teaching computers to play games and solve problems<sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup>.</p>
        <p>AI experienced ups and downs, with periods of optimism and setbacks like the AI "winters," where funding dried up<sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>. The 1980s saw a resurgence in AI, driven by expert systems and Japan's computer project<sup><a href="#ref5">5</a></sup>.</p>

    <!-- Types of AI -->
    <section id="types">
        <h2>Types of AI</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Narrow AI (Weak AI):</strong> AI designed for specific tasks, such as voice assistants and recommendation systems.</li>
            <li><strong>General AI (Strong AI):</strong> Theoretical AI that could perform any intellectual task that humans can do, including reasoning and understanding complex concepts<sup><a href="#ref6">6</a></sup>.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Machine Learning and Deep Learning -->
    <section id="mldl">
        <h2>Machine Learning and Deep Learning</h2>
        <p>Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves algorithms enabling machines to learn from data. Deep learning, a part of ML, uses neural networks with multiple layers to analyze patterns, advancing areas like speech recognition and image processing<sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Applications of AI -->
    <section id="applications">
        <h2>Applications of AI</h2>
        <p>AI has extensive applications, including healthcare, finance, autonomous vehicles, and entertainment. As AI technology continues to evolve, it transforms business operations and daily interactions with technology<sup><a href="#ref8">8</a></sup>.</p>
